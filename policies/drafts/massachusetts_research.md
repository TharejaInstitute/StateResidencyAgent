## Policy Type
**State Legislative Mandate**: Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 75, Section 34A sets the residency requirement for medical school tuition at UMass Chan.
> — Source: [3]

**CRITICAL**: Massachusetts has the **longest residency requirement** of any state - **7 CONSECUTIVE YEARS** (vs 1 year in most other states). — [3]

## Medical Schools in Massachusetts

| School | Type | In-State Preference |
|--------|------|---------------------|
| **UMass T.H. Chan School of Medicine** | PUBLIC | YES - 7 year residency requirement |
| Harvard Medical School | Private | NO - same tuition for all |
| Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine | Private | NO - same tuition for all |
| Tufts University School of Medicine | Private | NO - same tuition for all |

**Only UMass Chan has in-state vs out-of-state tuition distinction. This research focuses on UMass Chan.**

## The 7-Year Residency Rule

### Statutory Text (MGL c. 75, § 34A)
> — Source: [3]

> "If tuition for the medical school is set at a lower amount for residents of the commonwealth, a resident shall be deemed to be a person who has **resided in the Commonwealth for 7 consecutive years or more** prior to enrollment or a person whose **immediate family has resided in the Commonwealth for 7 consecutive years or more** prior to his enrollment."

### Key Definitions
> — Source: [1][3]

- **"Resided"** = Domicile (true fixed permanent home where one intends to remain permanently)
- **"Immediate family"** = Parent, spouse, child, or sibling

### Two Pathways to Residency
> — Source: [1][3]

**Pathway 1: Personal Residency**
- Applicant has lived in Massachusetts for 7+ consecutive years prior to enrollment

**Pathway 2: Family Residency**
- Applicant's immediate family (parent, spouse, child, sibling) has lived in MA for 7+ consecutive years prior to enrollment
- Applicant can be claimed as dependent OR independent

### School Attendance Does NOT Count
> — Source: [1]

**CRITICAL WARNING** (same as California and Hawaii):
"Attendance at a Massachusetts university or college does not, by itself, establish Massachusetts residency during that timeframe." — [1]

---

## Documentation Requirements
> — Source: [1]

### Primary Evidence (Required)
- **Seven (7) years of uninterrupted Federal AND Massachusetts tax returns** for the period immediately prior to enrollment — [1]
- Tax returns must list Massachusetts as the legal residence (not just a P.O. Box)
- If applicant is claimed as dependent: Parent/guardian tax returns must show MA residence

### Supporting Documentation
Additional documents may be requested:
- Permanent employment in Massachusetts
- Deed or lease agreements
- Mortgage/rent/utility receipts
- Valid Massachusetts driver's license
- Other evidence of domicile intent

### Burden of Proof
> — Source: [1]

- Rests on the applicant
- Each case decided on its own merits
- Qualitative (not quantitative) emphasis
- No single indicium is decisive

## Citizenship/Immigration Requirements

### Eligible to Apply to UMass Chan
> — Source: [2]

| Status | Can Apply? |
|--------|-----------|
| US Citizens | YES |
| US Permanent Residents | YES |
| Canadian Citizens | YES |
| Canadian Permanent Residents | YES |
| DACA Recipients | YES |

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION FROM OTHER STATES**:
- Massachusetts (UMass Chan) has a **citizenship requirement for admission**, not just for residency — [2]
- F-1/J-1 visa holders **CANNOT APPLY AT ALL** to UMass Chan — [2]
- This is different from California (UC schools accept F-1) and Hawaii (JABSOM accepts F-1)

## Class Composition & Acceptance Rates

## Tuition & Fees (2025-2026)

## MD-PhD Program Exception
> — Source: [2]

**IMPORTANT**: The MD-PhD program has DIFFERENT residency requirements:
- "Massachusetts residency is **NOT required** for application to the MD-PhD Program" — [2]
- MD-PhD applicants are evaluated regardless of state of residence
- This is a significant exception for out-of-state applicants interested in physician-scientist training

---

## Timing Considerations
> — Source: [1]

### Post-Acceptance Residency Changes

**If residency status changes BEFORE registration/enrollment:**
- Applicant becomes eligible for in-state tuition — [1]
- Must notify Office of Admissions and provide documentation

**If residency status changes AFTER registration/enrollment:**
- Remains classified as out-of-state for tuition purposes — [1]
- Classification is locked for duration of enrollment at UMass Chan

---

## Military Exemptions

**Note**: Specific military and veteran tuition exemptions at UMass Chan are not clearly documented in the sources reviewed. General federal requirements apply:
- Veterans using GI Bill benefits may qualify for in-state rates per federal Section 702 requirements
- Active duty military stationed in MA may have exemptions under federal law

Contact UMass Chan directly for current military/veteran policies.

## Common Applicant Questions

### Q: I've lived in Massachusetts for 4 years for college. Am I a resident?
**A:** NO. Even if you've lived in MA continuously: — [1][3]
1. School attendance alone doesn't establish residency
2. 4 years is less than the required 7 years
3. You would need 7 years of DOMICILE (not just presence for school)

### Q: My parents have lived in MA for 10 years, but I went to college out of state. Am I a resident?
**A:** YES. Your immediate family (parents) have met the 7-year requirement, which qualifies you for resident status regardless of where you personally lived. — [3]

### Q: I'm on an F-1 visa. Can I apply to UMass Chan?
**A:** NO. UMass Chan requires applicants to be US/Canadian citizens or permanent residents, or DACA/refugee/asylee. F-1 visa holders are NOT eligible to apply. — [2]

### Q: Can I establish MA residency during medical school to get in-state tuition?
**A:** NO. If you enroll as out-of-state, you remain classified as out-of-state for your entire enrollment, even if you would otherwise qualify for residency later. — [1]

### Q: I'm interested in the MD-PhD program. Does residency matter?
**A:** For MD-PhD, Massachusetts residency is NOT required. Out-of-state applicants are evaluated equally for the MD-PhD program. — [2]

### Q: What if I got married to a MA resident during the application cycle?
**A:** If your spouse has 7+ years of MA residency, you may qualify through the "immediate family" pathway. You must provide documentation and notify admissions BEFORE registration to be reclassified. — [1][3]

## Comparison to Other States

| Factor | Massachusetts | California | Texas | Hawaii |
|--------|---------------|------------|-------|--------|

| School attendance counts | NO | NO | Not addressed | NO |
| Family can qualify you | YES (immediate family) | YES (dependent only) | YES (parent/spouse) | NO (separate from tuition) |
| F-1 can apply | **NO** | YES | Varies by school | YES |
| DACA can apply | YES | YES | Varies by school | YES |
| Nonresident class % | 36% | ~23% | 10% (by law) | ~13% |
| In-state advantage | 6-8x higher acceptance | 4x higher acceptance | 9x (90% reserved) | 6-7x (87% resident) |

## Edge Cases to Investigate Further

- [ ] What exactly happens for military members stationed in MA? (Not clearly documented)
- [ ] What if parents divorced and one has 7 years in MA, one doesn't?
- [ ] Does sibling's 7-year residency count if parents don't live in MA?
- [ ] What about undocumented students without DACA? (Not explicitly addressed)
- [ ] How strictly is the "consecutive" part of 7 years enforced? (Temporary absences?)

## Key Takeaways for Applicants

1. **7 years is extremely long** - Most out-of-state applicants will NOT qualify unless family has MA ties
2. **Family pathway is powerful** - If a parent, spouse, or sibling has 7+ years in MA, you qualify
3. **F-1 visa holders cannot apply** - UMass Chan has a citizenship requirement
4. **Out-of-state acceptance is very competitive** - <1% acceptance rate
5. **MD-PhD is the exception** - No residency requirement for combined program
6. **Residency locks at enrollment** - Cannot change status once enrolled
7. **College attendance doesn't count** - 4 years of undergrad in MA doesn't help
