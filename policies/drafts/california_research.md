## Key Rules for Medical School Applicants

### Physical Presence Requirement
- **Duration**: 366+ days continuous physical presence in California
- **Timing**: Immediately prior to the "residence determination date" (first day of instruction)
- **CRITICAL WARNING**: Presence in California **solely for educational purposes** does NOT establish residency, regardless of duration

> — Source: [2][3]

### Financial Independence (DIFFERENT FROM UNDERGRADS)
- Graduate/professional students (including medical students) are **PRESUMED financially independent**
- Unlike undergrads, medical students do NOT need to prove financial independence
- Unlike undergrads, medical students do NOT automatically inherit parent's state
- This is a key distinction - a dependent undergrad would inherit parent's state, but a medical student is evaluated independently

> — Source: [3]

### Intent Requirements
Must establish intent to make California permanent home **more than one year before** the residence determination date.

> — Source: [2]

**Required Documentation:**
- California driver's license (must relinquish other state licenses)
- California voter registration
- California vehicle registration
- California address on all records

**Supporting Documentation:**
- California state tax returns
- California bank accounts
- Lease/property ownership in California
- Remaining in California during breaks

> — Source: [2][3]

### Immigration Status Requirements
Must have legal ability to establish permanent domicile in the United States. You must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, or you must have an immigration status that allows you to establish California residence.

> — Source: [1][2]

**Eligible Immigration Statuses:**
- US Citizens
- Permanent Residents (Green Card)
- Refugees, Asylees
- Those with qualifying nonimmigrant visas (see UCOP policy [3] for full list)

**INELIGIBLE Nonimmigrant Visa Types:**
> Per UCSF Registrar [1]:
> "You are not eligible to establish residence if you are an adult alien present in the U.S. with a nonimmigrant status that precludes you from establishing a domicile in the U.S. (including, but not limited to, B, F, H2, H3, J, M, O, P, Q, S, TN, and TD visas)"

Key ineligible categories:
- **F-1, F-2** (Student visa and dependents)
- **J-1, J-2** (Exchange visitor and dependents)
- **B-1, B-2** (Business/tourist)
- **H-2, H-3** (Temporary workers)
- **M** (Vocational student)
- **TN, TD** (NAFTA professionals)

**Note:** For a complete list of eligible vs ineligible visa types, consult the UC Residence Policy document [3] or contact the UCSF Residence Deputy directly.

### DACA and Undocumented Students (Detailed)

**AB540 Eligibility Requirements:**
Per UCSF Registrar [1], students who attended school in California may qualify for nonresident tuition exemption. General AB540 requirements:
- Attended California high school for 3+ years
- Graduated from California high school OR obtained GED in California
- Filed affidavit stating intent to legalize status when eligible

> — Source: [1]

**UC Medical Schools Accept DACA/Undocumented:**
> "UC Davis School of Medicine will continue to welcome and support pre-medical and medical students without regard to immigration status." — [6]
> "UCR School of Medicine explicitly welcomes undocumented and DACA students. Applications considered under same standards as other applicants. No Social Security Number required to apply." — [5]

**Important Limitations:**
- May have limitations on some clinical rotations (certain training sites)
- Licensure: California accepts undocumented physicians (requires taxpayer ID or SSN)
- Other states' licensure policies uncertain - affects residency training options
- No guarantee of admission to residency programs in other states

## Exemptions

### Military Exemptions
- **Active Duty**: Military members stationed in California on active duty, plus spouses and dependents, are entitled to resident classification
- **Duration**: For graduate/professional students, this waiver applies for no more than ONE academic year
- **Transfer/Retirement**: Dependent retains status for up to one academic year if military member transfers or retires, provided they're still claimed as federal tax dependent
- **Veterans**: Veterans using VA education benefits are exempt from nonresident tuition (effective August 1, 2021)

### Other Exemptions
- Dependent children under 21 of UC Academic Senate faculty
- AB540-eligible students (attended California schools for 3+ years)

## Admissions Preference (Beyond Tuition)

UC medical schools strongly prefer California residents in admissions (not just tuition):

**UCSF Statistics (Fall 2025):**
- **71% of matriculants are California residents** — [7]
- Total applications: 10,300
- Total matriculated: 161 (1.6% overall acceptance rate)
- Average age at matriculation: 23 years

> — Source: [7] (verified via browser 2026-01-06)

**Note:** In-state vs out-of-state acceptance rates are not separately reported on UCSF's public admissions data page. The strong California preference is evident from the 71% in-state matriculant rate.

## Common Misconceptions
> Based on rules documented in [2][3]

1. **"I've lived in CA for 2 years for undergrad, so I'm a CA resident for med school"**
   - FALSE: Presence for educational purposes does NOT count — [2][3]
   - You would need 366 days of NON-educational presence (e.g., working)

2. **"My parents claim me on taxes, so I inherit their CA residency"**
   - NOT APPLICABLE TO MED STUDENTS: Graduate students are presumed independent — [3]
   - This rule primarily affects undergraduates

3. **"I have a CA driver's license so I'm a resident"**
   - FALSE: Documentation alone doesn't establish residency — [2]
   - Must also have physical presence + intent + NOT here solely for education

4. **"I'm a tax resident of CA so I'm a tuition resident"**
   - FALSE: Tax residency ≠ tuition residency — [2]

## Timeline for Establishing Residency
> — Source: [2][3]

To claim residency for Fall enrollment:
1. Actions demonstrating intent must be completed by the end of instruction of the PREVIOUS Fall quarter — [2]
2. Must maintain continuous physical presence for 366+ days — [2][3]
3. Must NOT be present solely for educational purposes during this time — [2][3]

**Petition Deadlines:**
| Term | Deadline |
|------|----------|
| Fall | July 15 |
| Winter | October 15 |
| Spring | January 7 |

## Edge Cases to Investigate Further

- [ ] Gap year between undergrad and med school - does this count as non-educational presence?
- [ ] Part-time employment while in school - does this change the "solely educational" determination?
- [ ] What if parents live in CA but student attended undergrad out of state?
- [ ] Married students - does spouse's residency transfer?
