## Admissions Preference

> "Texas law limits non-residents to maximum 10% of entering class" in dental, medical, podiatric, and veterinary programs.

## Marriage Rule (Detailed)

**One of the most unique aspects of Texas residency.**

To establish residency through marriage:
- Your spouse must have established AND maintained domicile in Texas for 12 months prior to the application deadline
- You must have been married for at least one year
- Documentation required: Texas Marriage Certificate or Declaration of Registration of Informal Marriage

> — Source: [1][2]

**Example scenario:**

- You married spouse in January 2024
- By October 2024 application deadline: Spouse has 21 months of domicile, you have 9 months of marriage
- Result: NOT YET ELIGIBLE (need 12 months married)
- By October 2025: NOW ELIGIBLE (12+ months married to domiciled spouse)

## Dependent vs Independent Students

### Dependent Students
- A dependent student's residency is based on their parent's or legal guardian's residency
> "If the parent or court-appointed legal guardian of a dependent student meets the criteria of having established residency for tuition purposes, the dependent student is eligible to pay resident tuition" — [1]
- **CRITICAL**: "If your parents claim you and they live in another state, you are not eligible to establish residency while being claimed as a dependent" — [1]

### Independent Students
- Can establish residency independently through Option 2 (domicile)
- Must NOT be claimed as a dependent on parent's federal income taxes

### How to Become Independent
To be classified as independent, you generally need to:
- Be 18+ years old
- NOT be claimed as a dependent on anyone's federal taxes
- Support yourself financially

## Military Exemptions

### Home of Record = Texas
- Military member is **presumed to be a Texas resident**
- Spouse and dependent children also qualify
- No additional requirements

### Home of Record ≠ Texas BUT Claimed Texas Residence
- Must provide Leave and Earnings Statements (LES) showing Texas claimed as place of residence for 12 consecutive months prior to enrollment
- If requirements met: presumed Texas resident (self, spouse, dependents)
- If not: classified as Non-Texan, must pay non-resident tuition unless qualify for waiver

### Temporary Absence for Military Service
- Temporary absence from Texas for military service does NOT affect domicile status
- Must provide documentation of reason for absence
- Applies to: US Armed Forces, Public Health Service, Department of Defense, US Department of State

## Common Applicant Questions

### Q: I went to undergrad in Texas for 4 years. Am I a Texas resident?
**A:** Not automatically. It depends on:
- Were you claimed as a dependent by parents in another state? → Likely NOT a Texas resident
- Did you establish domicile (gainful employment, property, etc.)? → Possibly a Texas resident
- Did you graduate from a Texas high school with 36 months prior residence? → Possibly via Option 1

### Q: My parents moved to Texas while I was in college out of state. Am I a resident?
**A:** If you're still claimed as a dependent: YES, you may derive residency from your parents if they've established Texas domicile for 12 months by the deadline.

### Q: I'm getting married to a Texan. When can I claim residency?
**A:** You need:
1. Your spouse to have 12 months of established domicile in Texas
2. To be married for at least 12 months
Both must be true by the October 1 application deadline.

### Q: I have a Texas driver's license. Am I a resident?
**A:** A Texas driver's license alone does not establish residency. It's one piece of documentation, but you must also meet the physical presence and domicile requirements.

### Q: I'm on an F-1 visa and have lived in Texas for 4 years. Am I a resident?
**A:** Generally NO. F-1 visa holders cannot establish permanent domicile in the US, which is required for residency classification.

### Q: My DACA status was just approved. Can I apply to all Texas medical schools?
**A:** NO. Most Texas medical schools (12 of 15) only accept US citizens or permanent residents. Only Texas A&M, UT San Antonio Long, and Sam Houston State accept DACA applicants. See the DACA section above for the full list. — [1]

## Key Differences from California

| Factor | Texas | California |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Marriage transfers residency | YES (after 1 year married to domiciled spouse) | NO |
| School attendance counts | Not addressed (focus on domicile) | NO - explicitly doesn't count |
| Dependent students | Derive from parent | Graduate students presumed independent |
| DACA acceptance | Varies by school | Generally accepted at UC schools |
| Non-resident cap | 10% by law | No legal cap, but strong preference |
| Centralized determination | TMDSAS for all schools | Individual UC schools |

## Edge Cases to Investigate Further

- [ ] What qualifies as "gainful employment"? Part-time? How many hours?
- [ ] Can online business ownership count for domicile?
- [ ] What if parents are divorced and one lives in Texas, one out of state?
- [ ] Graduate students - are they presumed independent like in California?
- [ ] What happens if marriage ends during medical school?
