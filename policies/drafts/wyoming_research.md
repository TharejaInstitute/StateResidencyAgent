## Residency Requirements
> — Source: [1][3]

### The 5-Year Rule
> "You, your parent, or your legal guardian must be a legal resident of Wyoming for **five continuous years** preceding matriculation into medical school." — [1]

### Key Points
- **5 years continuous** (not cumulative) — [1]
- Can derive residency from **parent OR legal guardian** — [1][3]
- Must be **continuous** immediately prior to matriculation
- Requires **certification** by Wyoming Certifying Office — [3]

### Certification Process
> — Source: [3]

1. Apply to Wyoming WWAMI Certifying Office for residency certification
2. **Deadline**: October 15th of the year prior to anticipated enrollment — [3]
3. Applications received after deadline are **generally rejected** — [3]
4. Certification is SEPARATE from admission - can complete either first

**Contact**: Wyoming Certifying Office - certoff@uwyo.edu, 307-766-6704 — [3]

## Citizenship/Immigration Requirements

### Eligible Applicants
| Status | Eligible? |
|--------|-----------|
| US Citizens | YES |

|--------|-----------|
| **F-1 Visa (Student)** | **NO** |
| **J-1 Visa (Exchange)** | **NO** |

## Service Obligation (CONTRACT REQUIRED)
> — Source: [1][3]

### The 3-Year Commitment
Wyoming WWAMI students are **required to sign a contract** stating: — [1]
- Upon completion of residency training, return to Wyoming to practice medicine for **3 years**
- OR repay the subsidized tuition cost from Wyoming state government **plus interest** — [3]

### Why This Matters
- Wyoming subsidizes WWAMI tuition significantly — [3]
- The service obligation is legally binding
- Failure to return triggers financial penalty

### Historical Data
> — Source: [2]

- **162 of 262** Wyoming-WWAMI graduates have completed residency and returned to Wyoming to practice — [2]
- That's approximately **62% return rate**

## Common Applicant Questions

### Q: I'm from Wyoming but went to college out of state. Am I eligible?
**A:** YES, if: — [1][3]
1. You have 5+ continuous years of Wyoming residency (or your parent/guardian does)
2. You are a US citizen or permanent resident
3. You get certified by October 15

### Q: My parents moved to Wyoming 3 years ago. Can I apply?
**A:** NO. The requirement is **5 continuous years**. Wait until your parent has 5 years of Wyoming residency, then you can derive eligibility from them. — [1]

### Q: I'm on an F-1 visa. Can I apply to WWAMI?
**A:** NO. WWAMI only accepts US citizens and permanent residents. F-1 visa holders are not eligible. — [4][5]

### Q: Do I have to return to Wyoming after residency training?
**A:** You are contractually obligated to either: — [1][3]
1. Return to Wyoming and practice for 3 years, OR
2. Repay the subsidized tuition cost plus interest

### Q: What if I want to do my clinical rotations in Seattle?
**A:** Clinical rotation assignments are made based on educational needs and availability. You may or may not be placed in Seattle. Many Wyoming students do rotations throughout the WWAMI region. — [2]

**A:** NO. You are a **University of Washington School of Medicine student**. You receive a UW MD degree. WWAMI is the delivery mechanism for providing medical education across 5 states. — [2]

- WWAMI brings medical education TO the states rather than sending all students to Seattle — [2]

### Mission
- Train physicians who will **return to practice** in underserved areas — [2]
- 162 of 262 Wyoming-WWAMI graduates have returned to practice in Wyoming (~62%) — [2]

**Note**: Additional WWAMI statistics (founding year, primary care percentages) not verified from current sources.

## Edge Cases to Investigate Further

- [ ] What happens if parents divorce and only one remains in Wyoming?
- [ ] Can military members stationed in Wyoming count toward 5-year requirement?
- [ ] What if student establishes their own 5-year residency independent of parents?
- [ ] How strictly is the service obligation enforced? What is the repayment amount?
- [ ] Can DACA recipients apply? (Not clearly addressed in sources)
