## Policy Type
**DUAL SYSTEM**: Hawaii has TWO separate residency determinations:
1. **Admissions Residency** - JABSOM's "ties screening" (subjective, point-based) — [1]
2. **Tuition Residency** - Hawaii Administrative Rules (objective, 365-day requirement) — [4][5]

**CRITICAL**: You can be a "resident" for admissions purposes but NOT for tuition purposes, or vice versa.

## Medical Schools Covered
- John A. Burns School of Medicine (JABSOM) - Only medical school in Hawaii

## JABSOM Admissions Residency (Ties Screening)

### The Five Criteria
> — Source: [1]

JABSOM evaluates applicants on FIVE criteria to determine "resident" vs "nonresident" status **for admissions purposes**:

1. **Applicant's legal residence** (current state of residence)
2. **Parents' legal residence** (where parents currently live)
3. **Birthplace** (where applicant was born)
4. **High school location** (where applicant attended high school)
5. **College/university location** (where applicant attended undergrad)

### Classification Rule
> — Source: [1]

- **Resident for Admissions**: Must meet **minimum 2 out of 5** criteria with ties to Hawaii or Pacific Islands
- **Nonresident for Admissions**: Fewer than 2 criteria met

### Geographic Scope - Pacific Islands Included
> — Source: [1]

JABSOM considers ties to the following Pacific Islands EQUIVALENT to Hawaii ties:
- American Samoa
- Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI)
- Cook Islands
- Federated States of Micronesia (FSM)
- Futuna
- Guam
- Kiribati
- Nauru
- Niue
- Rapa Nui (Easter Island)
- Republic of Palau
- Republic of the Marshall Islands
- Solomon Islands
- Tokelau
- Tonga
- Tuvalu
- Vanuatu
- Wallis

**IMPORTANT**: Ties to ANY of these Pacific Islands count toward the 5 criteria.

### Class Composition
> — Source: [1]

- **~87% residents** (approximately 67 of 77 seats)
- **~13% nonresidents** (approximately 10 of 77 seats)

**Note**: Nonresident candidates must be "highly ranked, preferably with some ties to Hawaiʻi" to be accepted. — [1]

## Hawaii Tuition Residency (Separate from Admissions)

### Basic Requirements
> — Source: [4][5]

Per Hawaii Administrative Rules Title 20, Chapter 4:

1. **Physical Presence**: 365 consecutive days (one calendar year) in Hawaii prior to enrollment
2. **Bona Fide Residence**: Must demonstrate intent to make Hawaii permanent home
3. **Immigration Status**: Must be US citizen OR permanent resident (with exceptions below)

### Dependent Students
> — Source: [5]

- **Minors (under 18)**: Parents or legal guardians must be bona fide Hawaii residents for 365 days
- **Tax Dependency Rule**: Cannot be claimed as dependent by non-resident parents during the residency year

### School Attendance Does NOT Count
> — Source: [4][5]

**CRITICAL WARNING** (same as California):
- "Presence in Hawaii primarily to attend an institution of higher learning shall not create resident status" — [5]
- "A nonresident student enrolled for six credits or more per term shall be presumed to be in Hawaii primarily for educational purposes" — [5]
- Such enrollment periods do NOT count toward establishing residency

### Credit Limitation During Establishment
> — Source: [4][5]

If you're trying to establish residency while in Hawaii:
- **Limited to 5 semester credits** per semester at any Hawaii school
- If enrolled in 6+ credits, you're presumed to be in Hawaii for school, NOT to establish residency

## Tuition Rates (2025-2026)
> — Source: [3]

| Status | Annual Tuition |
|--------|----------------|
| Resident | $36,672 |
| Pacific Institutional Exemption | $55,008 (150% of resident) |

## Immigration Status Requirements

### For Tuition Residency
> — Source: [3][4][5]

**Eligible for Standard Residency (365 days + bona fide):**
- US Citizens
- Permanent Residents (Green Card holders)

**Eligible for Resident Tuition (Special Categories):**
> — Source: [3]

- **DACA recipients**: Eligible for resident tuition status
- **Undocumented students**: Eligible for resident tuition status
- **COFA Citizens** (as of July 1, 2024): Citizens of Federated States of Micronesia, Republic of Marshall Islands, and Republic of Palau qualify for in-state resident tuition

**Pacific Institutional Exemption (150% of resident tuition):**
> — Source: [3]

Citizens of Pacific Islands without baccalaureate-granting public institutions:
- American Samoa
- Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands
- Cook Islands
- Kiribati
- Nauru
- Niue
- Solomon Islands
- Tokelau
- Tonga
- Tuvalu
- Vanuatu
- Futuna/Wallis

**INELIGIBLE for Resident Tuition:**
> — Source: [4][5]

- F-1 visa holders (student visa)
- J-1 visa holders (exchange visitor)
- Other temporary nonimmigrant visas

**Note**: Unlike California/Texas, Hawaii does not provide a comprehensive list of which specific visa types CAN establish residency. The general rule is "US citizen or permanent resident" with the DACA/COFA exceptions noted above.

---

## F-1 Visa Implications (IMPORTANT FOR SCHOOL LIST DECISIONS)
> — Source: [1][2][3]

**KEY INSIGHT**: Hawaii's dual-system creates a unique situation for F-1 visa holders:

### For F-1 Students WITH Hawaii/Pacific Island Ties:
- **Can apply to JABSOM**: YES (no citizenship requirement for admission) — [2]
- **Admissions classification**: RESIDENT (if 2+ ties criteria met) — [1]
- **Seat pool**: Competes for 67 resident seats (vs 10 nonresident seats) — [1]
- **Tuition**: Non-resident ($71,328/year) - cannot establish tuition residency — [3][4]
- **Federal financial aid**: NOT available (F-1 ineligible)

**Example Scenario**: An F-1 student from Guam who attended high school in Hawaii would have 2 criteria (birthplace in Pacific Islands + HS in Hawaii). They would be classified as "resident for admissions" and compete for the larger resident seat pool, but still pay non-resident tuition.

### Why This Matters for School List:
1. **Admission chances**: F-1 with HI/Pacific ties has MUCH better odds than applying as true nonresident — [1]
2. **Still very expensive**: $71K/year tuition with no federal aid access — [3]
3. **Comparison to other states**:
   - California: F-1 cannot establish residency, but UC schools accept international applicants
   - Texas: Some TMDSAS schools explicitly reject non-US citizens/permanent residents
   - Massachusetts (UMass Chan): F-1 CANNOT apply at all (citizenship requirement)

### Recommendation for F-1 with Hawaii/Pacific Ties:
- JABSOM may be worth applying to despite high cost
- Better admission odds than most other public schools
- Consider alongside private schools (which have same tuition for all applicants)

### For JABSOM Admission (Not Tuition)
> — Source: [2]

**JABSOM explicitly states**: "Applicants are considered for admission to JABSOM without regard to their country of origin." — [2]

This means:
- International students CAN apply to JABSOM
- No citizenship requirement for admission
- However, limited to ~10 nonresident seats per class — [1]
- Must complete 90 semester credits at US/Canadian institution — [2]

## Military Exemptions
> — Source: [4][5]

The following categories qualify for resident tuition WITHOUT the 365-day requirement:

1. **Active Duty Military**: US military personnel stationed in Hawaii on active duty
2. **Authorized Family Members**: Spouses and dependents of active duty stationed in Hawaii
3. **Hawaii National Guard**: Members of the Hawaii National Guard
4. **Hawaii-based Reserves**: Members of Hawaii-based Reserve units
5. **Foreign Military Training**: Active duty military from other countries (on visa) while training with US military in Hawaii

**Note**: This exemption applies ONLY during the period of active duty/stationing. — [4]

## Common Applicant Questions

### Q: I was born in Hawaii but left as a child. Am I a resident for admissions?
**A:** Birthplace is ONE of the 5 criteria. You'd still need ONE more criterion (parents in HI, high school in HI, etc.) to reach the minimum 2 points for "resident" status for admissions purposes. — [1]

### Q: I'm a resident for admissions (2+ criteria) but haven't lived in Hawaii for a year. What tuition do I pay?
**A:** You would pay NON-RESIDENT tuition ($71,328/year) unless you qualify for an exemption (military, Pacific Island citizen, DACA, etc.). Admissions residency and tuition residency are SEPARATE determinations. — [1][3][4]

### Q: I'm on an F-1 visa and went to high school and college in Hawaii. Can I be a resident?
**A:** For ADMISSIONS purposes: YES - you have 2 criteria (HS + college location) — [1]
For TUITION purposes: NO - F-1 visa holders cannot establish tuition residency and pay non-resident rates. — [4][5]

### Q: I'm from Guam. How does JABSOM treat me?
**A:**
- ADMISSIONS: You're treated as having ties to Hawaii (Guam is in the Pacific Islands list) — [1]
- TUITION: You may qualify for the Pacific Institutional Exemption (150% of resident = $55,008) rather than full non-resident — [3]

### Q: I'm from the Marshall Islands. What's my tuition?
**A:** As of July 2024, COFA citizens (including Marshall Islands) qualify for IN-STATE resident tuition ($36,672/year). — [3]

### Q: Can international students apply to JABSOM?
**A:** YES. JABSOM accepts applicants "without regard to country of origin." — [2] However:
- Limited to ~10 nonresident seats per class — [1]
- Must complete 90 semester credits at US/Canadian school — [2]
- Federal financial aid only available to US citizens/permanent residents

### Q: How is Hawaii different from California?
**A:** Key differences:
- Hawaii uses a SUBJECTIVE "ties" screening for admissions (5 criteria, need 2) — [1]
- California uses OBJECTIVE criteria (366 days, financial independence, documentation)
- Hawaii explicitly includes Pacific Islands as equivalent to in-state — [1]
- Both states don't count school attendance toward tuition residency — [4][5]

## Edge Cases to Investigate Further

- [ ] How are dependents of H-1B workers treated for tuition? (Hawaii rules unclear)
- [ ] What if parents are divorced - one in Hawaii, one mainland?
- [ ] Does Native Hawaiian ancestry affect any residency determination?
- [ ] How does the 5-credit limit work for graduate students trying to establish residency?
- [ ] What documentation does JABSOM require to verify ties claims?

## Key Differences from Other States

| Factor | Hawaii | California | Texas |
|--------|--------|------------|-------|
| Admissions Residency | Subjective "ties" screening (2 of 5 criteria) | Objective criteria | Objective criteria |
| Pacific Islands included | YES - 17+ island nations equivalent to HI | NO | NO |
| School attendance counts for tuition | NO | NO | Not addressed |
| DACA/undocumented | Eligible for resident tuition | Eligible (AB540) | Varies by school |
| COFA citizens | Resident tuition (July 2024) | Unknown | Unknown |
| Marriage transfers residency | Not mentioned | NO | YES |
| Nonresident cap | ~13% (10 of 77 seats) | No legal cap (~23% OOS) | 10% by law |
| Financial independence presumed for grad students | Not mentioned | YES | Unclear |
