    wsu: "Washington only"
  - factor: "Out-of-state possible"
    uw: "Yes (WWAMI + limited out-of-region)"

  - factor: "Ties pathway"
    uw: "Yes (out-of-region, requires disadvantaged/service)"
    wsu: "Yes (3 of 4 criteria, standalone)"
  - factor: "Class size"
    uw: 280
    wsu: 80
  - factor: "Tuition differential"
    uw: "Yes (resident vs non)"
    wsu: "No (all pay in-state)"
  - factor: "DACA eligible"
    uw: "YES (with state verification)"
    wsu: "NO (not mentioned)"

research_gaps:
  - "What exactly counts as 'childhood address' for WSU ties pathway?"
  - "How does WSU verify the 4 ties criteria?"
  - "Can military stationed in WA use ties pathway or only legal residency pathway?"
  - "What documentation does UW require for DACA verification?"
  - "How long must childhood address have been in WA for WSU?"
  - "What if parents divorced and only one lives in WA?"
