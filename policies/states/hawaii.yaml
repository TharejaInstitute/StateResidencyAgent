notes:
  - "Hawaii uses TIES SCREENING, not duration-based residency"
  - "5 criteria: applicant residence, parent residence, birthplace, high school, college"
  - "Need 2 of 5 criteria for resident classification"
  - "17+ Pacific Island nations/territories count same as Hawaii ties"
  - "Only one medical school: JABSOM (MD)"
  - "No DO schools in Hawaii"

examples:
  - scenario: "Born in Hawaii, left as child"
    birthplace: hawaii  # 1 criterion
    outcome: "Need at least 1 more criterion (parents still in HI? HS in HI?) - if only 1, classified NONRESIDENT"
  - scenario: "From Guam, college on mainland"
    birthplace: guam  # Pacific Island = 1 criterion
    parent_residence: guam  # 2nd criterion
    outcome: "RESIDENT classification (2 criteria met)"
  - scenario: "F-1 student from Japan, all schooling in Hawaii"
    high_school: hawaii  # 1 criterion
    college: hawaii  # 2nd criterion
    outcome: "RESIDENT classification (2 criteria met) - immigration status doesn't affect classification"
  - scenario: "Mainland US applicant, no Hawaii/Pacific ties"
    all_criteria: mainland_us
    outcome: "NONRESIDENT - competes for ~10 nonresident seats"

research_gaps:
  - "Can applicants appeal ties screening classification?"
  - "How are split criteria evaluated (e.g., multiple high schools)?"
  - "What documentation is required to verify Pacific Island ties?"
  - "How competitive are the 10 nonresident seats?"
  - "Are COFA citizens from non-listed Pacific nations treated equivalently?"
