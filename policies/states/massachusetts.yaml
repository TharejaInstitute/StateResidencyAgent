  supporting:
    - employment_proof
    - deed_or_lease

  notes:
    - "7 years of uninterrupted Federal AND Massachusetts tax returns required"

notes:
  - "7 years is virtually impossible to establish from scratch before applying"
  - "Family pathway is key - parent, spouse, child, or sibling with 7+ years qualifies you"
  - "Sibling pathway is unique to Massachusetts - can qualify through brother/sister"
  - "College attendance in MA does NOT count toward 7-year requirement"
  - "Only UMass Chan has state preference - Harvard, BU, Tufts are private"

examples:
  - scenario: "4 years undergrad in MA"
    situation: "Attended Boston College for undergrad, now applying to UMass Chan"
    classification: "NON-RESIDENT"
    reason: "School doesn't count, only 4 years anyway"
  - scenario: "Parents in MA for 10 years"
    situation: "Parents in MA 10 years, applicant went to college out of state"
    classification: "RESIDENT"
    reason: "Parents' 7+ years qualifies applicant via family derivation"
  - scenario: "Sibling in MA for 8 years"
    situation: "Sibling has lived in MA for 8 years, applicant has never lived there"
    classification: "RESIDENT"
    reason: "Sibling qualifies as immediate family under MA law"
  - scenario: "F-1 visa student"
    situation: "International student on F-1 visa"
    classification: "CANNOT APPLY"
    reason: "UMass Chan has citizenship requirement - F-1/J-1 ineligible"

research_gaps:
  - "How strictly is the 7-year requirement enforced? Any discretion?"
  - "What if family member's 7 years includes time as student?"
  - "Can adoptive siblings qualify under family derivation?"
  - "Step-siblings or half-siblings eligibility?"
  - "What happens if family member moves out of MA during application cycle?"
  - "How does UMass Chan verify family member's residency?"
