notes:
  - "366 days required - must be continuous, immediately prior to enrollment"
  - "School attendance does NOT count - biggest trap for applicants"
  - "Grad students are independent - evaluated on own residency, not parents'"
  - "F-1 can apply but can't be resident - always classified as non-resident"
  - "DACA/undocumented welcome at UC schools"
  - "77% in-state at UCSF - strong practical advantage for CA residents"
  - "Intent must be 1+ year before - documentation required early"
  - "Regional preferences matter - UC Davis (Northern CA), UC Riverside (Inland SoCal), CUSM (Inland Empire)"

examples:
  - scenario: "4 years undergrad in California"
    situation: "Attended UCLA for undergrad, now applying to UC medical schools"
    classification: "NON-RESIDENT"
    reason: "Educational presence doesn't count, regardless of duration"
    path_to_resident: "Need 366 days of working/living in CA NOT for school"
  - scenario: "Parents in California"
    situation: "Parents live in CA, applicant went to college out of state"
    classification: "Evaluated on YOUR residency (grad students are independent)"
    note: "Parent's CA residence doesn't automatically transfer to grad students"
  - scenario: "Gap year in California"
    situation: "Took gap year working in CA before medical school"
    classification: "Potentially RESIDENT if 366+ days with proper intent documentation"
    key: "Must not be 'primarily for educational purposes'"
  - scenario: "F-1 student"
    situation: "International student on F-1 visa"
    classification: "Can APPLY but CANNOT establish CA residency"
    result: "Will be classified as non-resident regardless of time in California"

research_gaps:
  - "Does part-time enrollment count as educational presence?"
  - "How strictly is the 1-year intent timing enforced?"
  - "What happens if intent documentation is completed exactly 1 year before?"
  - "Can F-1 students who adjust to green card during application cycle become residents?"
  - "How do UC schools verify domicile vs educational presence?"
