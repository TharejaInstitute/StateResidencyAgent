notes:
  - "90% reserved for residents - Texas law caps non-residents at 10%"
  - "Marriage can transfer residency - Spouse must have 12mo domicile, you must be married 12mo"
  - "Two pathways - HS graduation route OR domicile establishment"
  - "Dependents inherit parent's state - Cannot independently establish while claimed as dependent"
  - "DACA varies by school - Only 3 of 15 schools accept DACA"
  - "F-1/J-1 cannot establish residency - Not eligible for Texas residency classification"
  - "TMDSAS centralizes - One system determines residency for all TMDSAS schools"
  - "Regional preferences exist - Many schools prefer specific Texas regions"
  - "Mission fit matters - UH Fertitta screens for primary care commitment before sending secondaries"
  - "Secondary questions reveal preferences - UT Tyler, Texas Tech, UTMB explicitly ask about regional ties"

examples:
  - scenario: "4 years undergrad in Texas"
    question: "Am I a Texas resident?"
    answer: "Not automatically. Depends on: Were you claimed as dependent by out-of-state parents? Did you establish domicile (employment, property, etc.)? Did you graduate from Texas HS?"
  - scenario: "Parents moved to Texas while I was in college"
    question: "Am I a resident?"
    answer: "If still claimed as dependent: YES, may derive residency from parents if they've established Texas domicile for 12 months by deadline"
  - scenario: "Marrying a Texan"
    question: "When can I claim residency?"
    answer: "Need: (1) Spouse to have 12 months established domicile, (2) Be married 12+ months. Both must be true by October 1 deadline"
  - scenario: "F-1 visa, lived in Texas 4 years"
    question: "Am I a resident?"
    answer: "NO. F-1 visa holders cannot establish permanent domicile required for residency classification"
  - scenario: "DACA just approved"
    question: "Can I apply to all Texas schools?"
    answer: "NO. Only 3 schools accept DACA: Texas A&M, UT San Antonio Long, Sam Houston State"

research_gaps:
  - "What qualifies as 'gainful employment'? Part-time? How many hours?"
  - "Can online business ownership count for domicile?"
  - "What if parents are divorced and one lives in Texas, one out of state?"
  - "Graduate students - are they presumed independent like in California?"
  - "What happens if marriage ends during medical school?"
  - "Can gap year before HS graduation count toward 36-month requirement?"
